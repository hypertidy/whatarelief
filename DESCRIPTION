Title: Get topography elevation data
Version: 0.0.1
Authors@R: person("Michael D.","Sumner", role = c("aut", "cre"), email = "mdsumner@gmail.com")
Description: Obtain elevation data, topography relief for any region on the Earth. Topography and
 bathymetry data is supported by default. Sensible defaults exist for usage, with a matrix of entire planet
 topography(and bathymetry) returned. The geographic extent can be modified (from whole-planet) to a simple
 region in longitude/latitude by 'xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax' range, or by specifying a grid exactly with extent,
 dimension, projection in generic or spatial formats ('terra' or 'raster'). Online sources for data are used, 
 'GEBCO 2019' as a background (to ~500m resolution) and 'SRTM/NASADEM' for higher resolution (to ~30m resolution).
 Custom source/s of topography may be input to override defaults, links to file/s or URLs as required.

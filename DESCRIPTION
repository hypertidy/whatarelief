Title: Get topography elevation data
Version: 0.0.1.9008
Authors@R: person("Michael D.","Sumner", role = c("aut", "cre"), email = "mdsumner@gmail.com")
Description: Obtain elevation data, topography relief for any region on the Earth. 
 Topography and bathymetry data is supported by default. Sensible defaults exist 
 for usage, with a matrix of entire planet topography(and bathymetry) returned. 
 The geographic extent can be modified (from whole-planet) to a simple region in 
 longitude/latitude by 'xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax' range, or by specifying a grid 
 exactly with extent, dimension, projection in generic or spatial formats 
 ('terra' or 'raster'). Online sources for data are used, 'GEBCO_2021' General 
 Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO) as a background (to ~500m resolution), 
 and Copernicus GLO-30 Digital Elevation Model for higher resolution 
 (to ~30m resolution). Custom source/s of topography may be input to override defaults, 
 links to file/s or URLs as required.
